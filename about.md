# About


<!--author-->

Outside of education, I have also been a competitive swimmer for over 10 years, an avid climber and runner(Currently training for a marathon) and a Speed Cuber! My current record for the standard 3x3 is 8.48 which I break down further in [3x3 PB](/blogs/cubingcube-pb/). And during my down time I love to play [games](/gaming/)!

## My Motto
When I was younger, I typically excel in whatever that was put forth on me, I always the poor thinking that I was smart, that I was the best at everything. However, this thinking was soon to change drastically, as I started competitive swimming at the age of 11. This was a pivot point in my life, as it opened my eyes to the vast talent in the world, as no matter how hard I tried at times I never seem to come close to others. I was demotivated, I thought to myself, "there is no way I can be as good," I thought I was nothing. But it was also around this time where I was into anime, and at anime I was watching at the time was ['Naruto'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/). 

For those who know the anime, Naruto was no one special, he was not talented in ['Ninjutsu' (Combat Techniques in Naruto)](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ninjutsu) especially compared to his rival Sasuke who was born a genius. However, throughout the show, Naruto would use both pure hardwork and determination to bridge the gap between them. Which was inspiring as I thought to myself that maybe I just needed hardwork! However, the one scene that really stuck with me from Naruto was when Rock Lee who just like Naruto was no genius, in fact Lee had it much worst as he was not even able to use [Chakara(Spiritual Energy found in the Naruto Universe)](https://narutoprofile.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra#:~:text=Chakra%20is%20the%20resulting%20form,training%2C%20stimulants%2C%20and%20exercise.) said this to Sasuke,
> "A Dropout will beat a genius through hardwork" - Rock Lee
{:.lead}

This stuck with me, and has been a motto that I occasionally use to remind and motivate myself that hardwork is the key to success!
