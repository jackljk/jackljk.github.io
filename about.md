# About (WIP)


<!--author-->

As a data science student, I am fluent in Python and have experience in Java, JavaScript, LaTeX, and R. I am also proficient in Git, GitHub, SQL, and SQLite, which I have used in various projects during my studies. My main interests lie in the areas of machine learning and deep learning, specifically in natural language processing (NLP). 

However, I am always open to exploring new options and expanding my knowledge in all things tech.

I am actively seeking an internship opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the field and continue to develop my skills. I am a quick learner and am always eager to take on new challenges.

Outside of education and coding, I have a passion for fitness and staying active. I have been swimming for over 10 years, and I also enjoy running, rock climbing, solving Rubik's cubes (my personal best is 8.46 seconds), and PC gaming. 
I believe that a healthy mind and body is essential for success and I strive to maintain balance in my life through my hobbies.

Please take a look around my portfolio website to see some of my work and to learn more about me. If you have any internship opportunities or are looking for a driven and dedicated student to work on your project, please feel free to reach out to me. 

I am excited to see where my passion for data science and technology will take me and look forward to working with you in the future.
