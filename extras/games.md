## Games
**[God Of War 2018](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/)** - 10/10 - One of the best games I've ever played, the story, the combat, the graphics, the music, everything was perfect. 

**[Elden Ring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/)** - 10/10 - In my opinion, the best souls game I have ever played. The story was intriguing, combat was hard and highly rewarded skill, there was amazing world building and the graphics were amazing. Also the unlimited character customization and play styles was amazing.

**[Starfield](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/)** - 9/10 - Still currently playing but is already one of the best space/sci-fi games I've ever played. So far the story is intrested, the graphics are probably one of the best I have ever seen. The game is extremely complicated with a large number of planets one can explore, with amazing combat mechanics and am amazing space battle combat mechanics as well. The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because I haven't finished the game yet.

**[Zelda Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch/)** - 9/10 - Haven't always been a fan of Zelda Games but TOTK was amazing, the puzzles were very well made and the story was very interesting and combat is fun as Zelda games usually are.

**[Pokemon Scarlett and Violet](https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/)** - 9/10 - Being one of the first open world pokemon games it was in my opinion incredibly well made and was a one of the better pokemon games I've played. I 100% the game and it was a blast.

**[Doom Eternal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/)** 7/10 - Doom Eternal was an amazing game, however for me it lacked a few things. I love the idea of the constant shooting and PVE however, I just wish there was more than that, it is still one of the best games I've ever played regardless.

**[High on Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583230/High_On_Life/)** - 5/10 - I love the idea of the game and I was very excited to play, having the writer of Rick and Morty one of my favourite shows made be extremely excited for the game. However, upon playing it, the graphics were really nice and really well made, but although this rarely happens to be, the motion blur and camera movements just gave me incredibly bad headaches and nausea. This is a bad sign and incredibly horrible for the game, as I play VR games as well and I have never got nausea so easily, but for a First person shooter story game on a regular screen to give me nausea I couldn't finish the game.

**[Horizon Zero Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/)** - 9/10 - The story is amazing, although I have not completed it yet either, I am extremely excited to finish it. The combat is amazing and the graphics are amazing, and the idea of a world where humans are no longer the dominant species and the wold is teeming with machines that resemble animals is one of the best ideas for a game/story ever.

**[Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)** - 10/10 - Hades is probably the best Roguelike game I have ever played. The combat is fun, it isn't too repetitive like many roguelike games are, there is a highly indepth lore and story to follow and of course the graphics are top notch. 

**[Half-Life Alyx](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/)** 10/10 - This game is hands down the best VR game in the market right now. The controls are seemless, the option for teleportation movement or free movement is really good as it helps deal with motion sickness and nausea which this game never caused any of that. To top it off, the story was one of the best for the Half-Life series and that coupled with the most seemless, smooth and fun VR controls this game is a must play for anyone with a VR headset.

**[Dota 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/)** - This game is my MOBA of choice and the game I have spent the most hours on for any game, which is sitting at 1700 hours and counting.

**[Counter Strike Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/)** - This game is my mulitplayer FPS of choice being one of the most iconic and best FPS mechanics and shooting of all time I definitely still prefer this over Valorant.

**[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)** - This game was my childhood, it is the first PC game I've ever played and to this day I still really enjoy playing it. Even after around 10 or so years of playing the game it is still one of my favourite games of all time and definitely the best sandbox game of all time in my eyes.
