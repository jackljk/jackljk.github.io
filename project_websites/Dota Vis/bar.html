            In Dota 2, gaining an edge over other players can be the difference
            between winning and losing. In the game I play, I want to have a
            comprehensive understanding of which heroes have the highest base
            stats (strength, agility, and intelligence) without any items
            equipped. By having this knowledge, I can make strategic decisions
            about which heroes to select based on their inherent strengths.
            <br /><br />
            In addition to determining which heroes have the highest base stats,
            I also want to compare the base stats of each hero at level 1 versus
            level 30 to see how much they increase over time. This will allow me
            to predict how each hero will perform at different points in the
            game and plan my strategy accordingly.
            <br /><br />
            By having access to this information, I can gain a significant
            advantage over other players who may not have taken the time to
            analyze the game in the same way. Rather than relying solely on my
            own skill and intuition, I can make informed decisions based on
            objective data. This will give me a better chance of succeeding in
            the game and achieving my goals. 
            <br><br>
            <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Marks -</span> The marks in the horizontal bar chart are
            represented by bars, which are used to show the difference in total
            stats between the heroes. 
            <br><br>
            <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Channels -</span>are represented by the vertical height of
            each stacked bar and the entire bar as a whole. Another channel is
            the color of the different stacked bars, which differentiates the
            different stats. Red is used for strength, green for agility, and
            blue for intelligence, as these colors are commonly associated with
            these attributes in the game.
            <br><br>
            <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Design Considerations -</span>include buttons to see
            the values of the heroes when they are level 1 or level 30, the
            ability to sort by many different methods in order to more easily
            see the patterns and search for the heroes who are better in each
            regard, and a tooltip to see the raw values of the stats, showing
            both the stat you are hovering over and the total sum of all the
            stats. Overflow scrolling is used so the graph's size is not overly
            large, as the data of over 100 heroes is displayed. A horizontal Bar
            chart is used so the scrolling seems more clean and the values are
            just shown in a much more clean manner.
