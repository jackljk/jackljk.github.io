    <h2>Roles Visualization - Node and Link</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Becoming skilled at Dota 2 requires more than just mechanical skill and
        game sense. Understanding the many roles of heroes in the game is
        crucial for success. Every hero in Dota 2 has a unique task or use to
        help their team, and players who can identify and adapt to these roles
        will have an advantage in the game.
        <br /><br />
        That said, with over 100 heroes in the game, it can be challenging to
        keep track of all their roles and abilities. Fortunately, there are
        tools and resources available to help players learn and understand these
        roles. One such tool is a node and link diagram, which is a
        visualization that shows the unique roles of all the heroes in Dota 2.
        <br /><br />
        The node and link diagram works by categorizing each hero into their
        respective roles and displaying them as nodes in the diagram. The nodes'
        sizes depend on the number of heroes with that specific role, and the
        links connect the smaller nodes (heroes) to the larger nodes (roles)
        they belong to. The diagram is interactive, allowing players to hover
        over the roles to see how many heroes have that role and highlight the
        links to the roles that the hero has. The diagram also includes
        animations, making it a fun and engaging way to learn about the game's
        many roles.
        <br /><br />
        Having access to this tool can be incredibly helpful, especially for
        newer players who are still learning the game's ins and outs. By
        referring to the visualization, players can quickly and easily identify
        a hero's role and understand what they do. This knowledge can help
        players make better decisions in the game, such as when and where to
        engage in combat, which items to purchase, and how to support their team
        effectively.

        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Marks -</span> The nodes are one of the marks, which show either the heroes
        or the roles. The links are the other mark, which shows the connection
        between the heroes and the nodes that represent the roles they have.
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Channels -</span>The channels are the size of the role nodes tells us the number of heroes
        classified under that role. 
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Design Considerations-</span> One of the design considerations are the Tooltips that
         appear when hovering over the hero nodes to see the hero names.
        There are also Tooltips that appear when hovering over the role nodes to see the raw
        values of the role node. Hovering over the hero nodes should highlight
        its links to the roles it fulfills. Hovering over the role nodes should
        highlight the links to all the heroes that fulfill that role.
