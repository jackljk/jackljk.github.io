    <h2>Hero win/pick rates - lollipop</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Dota 2 is a complex game with a vast roster of heroes to choose from.
        The key to success in Dota 2 is not just about mastering a single hero,
        but also about understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each hero
        and how they fit into different team compositions. In order to gain an
        advantage in Dota 2, advance in ranks, and eventually reach the immortal
        rank, it is important to determine which heroes are being played at
        every rank and what their win rates are.
        <br /><br />
        To achieve this, a graph was plotted that shows the win rates and pick
        rates for every single hero in the game. This information can help
        determine which hero to pick at which rank and who has the best overall
        win rate in each rank. The graph is in the form of a horizontal lollipop
        graph, which makes it easy to visualize the data. The win rate is
        calculated as the ratio of the number of times a hero has been picked to
        the number of times they have won. The pick rate is the number of times
        the hero has been pick at that rank.
        <br /><br />
        To make the graph more interactive, a selector was added that allows the
        user to choose a hero. The hero choosing menu is designed to be similar
        to the one in Dota, making it easy for users to find the hero they want.
        The graph also includes animations to make it more engaging, images on
        the axis to make it more visually appealing, and a tooltip that shows
        raw numbers.
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Marks -</span> The marks on the graph are the lines and circles. I chose a
        lollipop graph, which has a line and a circle, to show the difference in
        win rates of each hero. The line acts like a bar to show the distance
        from the y-axis, while the circle allows users to hover over the point
        and see the raw win percentage and show the position. 
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Channels -</span> The
        channel mainly refers to the position of the circle. The line just
        connects the point to the axis to create the look of distance from the
        y-axis, but ultimately the position of the circle is the channel that
        tells us the value of the data. 
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Design Considerations -</span> The
        design includes a menu that allows users to select which heroes they
        want to view statistics for, including win rates. Tooltips were added to
        display the exact win rate value, rather than just an estimation based
        on the graph. Images for each rank were also added to improve visual
        appeal and make it easier to identify the represented rank.
