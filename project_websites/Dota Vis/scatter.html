    <h2>Hero Win Rates - Scatterplot</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        One of the keys to success in any competitive game is to have a strong
        understanding of the heroes or characters that you are playing with. In
        the popular game Dota 2, this means knowing which heroes are the most
        effective in the current meta, as well as which heroes are the most
        popular.
        <br />
        <br />
        To gain an upper hand on my opponents, I have decided to create a
        scatterplot that shows the number of wins each hero gets in relation to
        the number of times that hero is picked in the game. This will allow me
        to visually see which heroes are the most popular and effective, and
        will help me understand which heroes I should prioritize when playing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Typically, in a game like Dota 2, the most popular heroes are popular
        for a few reasons. First, in the current patch of the game, they are
        stronger and more viable heroes in the meta. This means that they are
        more likely to contribute to a win, and that players who use them are
        more likely to be successful. Secondly, if a hero is popular, it also
        means that they are heroes that are fun to play. This can add an
        additional benefit that would make me more motivated to play well.
        <br />
        <br />
        By creating this scatterplot, I hope to gain a better understanding of
        the heroes that are being used most frequently in the game, and which
        heroes are the most effective. This will allow me to make more informed
        decisions when choosing which hero to use, and will give me a better
        chance of succeeding in the game.

        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Marks -</span> The marks in the graph are the points designated by the hero
        icons. This provides an easier visualization of which point correlates
        to which heroes. 
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Channels - </span>The position of each point on the graph
        indicates the win rate and pick rate of the heroes. Heroes with a higher
        win rate are placed higher up on the y-axis, while more popular heroes
        are placed further to the right on the x-axis. \
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Design Considerations - </span> To make the scatter plot more interactive, the design includes the
        ability to zoom in and out of the graph. This is useful since a lot of
        the data are clumped together and are sometimes hard to pick out
        individually. This allows the user to hone in at points that they want
        and see the point/hero of interest more clearly. Additionally, a tooltip
        is included to provide the exact number of the win and pick, making it
        easier to see and read the raw number of the point.
