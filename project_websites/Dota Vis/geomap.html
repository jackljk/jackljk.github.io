    <h2>Best Player by country - Geomap</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        In order to become better at any skill, it is essential to challenge
        oneself by playing against people who are more skilled. This is
        especially true for competitive games where the level of competition can
        often make the difference between winning and losing. As a result, it is
        important to identify the regions of the world where the best players
        for a particular game are located.
        <br /><br />
        To address this need, I created a world map visualization that displays
        the number of "professional" players in each country for the game in
        question. By looking at this map, I can quickly and easily identify the
        countries with the most skilled players. Additionally, I added an
        interactive tooltip that displays the information of a random player
        located in a specific country every time the user hovers over it. This
        feature makes the visualization more engaging for the user and provides
        additional insight into the skills of players from different regions.
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Marks -</span> They are the individual shape of the countries is drawn, colored, and
        shaded. I chose to use a choropleth map as it visually shows the
        location of the user's interest in the world. 
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Channels -</span> The channels are the color saturation of each mark on the choropleth. I opted for a
        choropleth map as the color saturation can quickly indicate the number
        of pro players in a given region. 
        <br /><br />
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Design Considerations -</span> I
        added a tooltip to display the raw number of pro players located in a
        country. An image of the country's flag is included to aid in
        identification. The tooltip also highlights a random player from that
        country to provide examples and ideas of players who live there.
