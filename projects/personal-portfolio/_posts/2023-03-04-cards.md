I wanted to create a visually appealing way to showcase my projects on my about page as it is often the first page visitors click on when they visit my website. To make my projects stand out, I coded these custom cards using CSS and Javascript. These cards not only make my projects more eye-catching, but they also provide a more organized and professional look to my website.

## Here is a preview of the cards:
<div id = "my-project-cards">
<div id = "project-cards">
    <a class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\dota.webp"><p>Dota 2 Muerta</p></div>
    </a>
    <a class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\gojo.jpg"><p>Jujutsu Kaisen Gojo</p></div>
    </a>
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\placeholder.png"><p>PlaceHolder</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\sasuke.jpg"><p>Naruto Sasuke</p></div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>

Now I am going to walkthrough how you make the cards on your own website!

## Making the cards
First thing we are going to do is to create the divs that will house the cards.
```html
<div id="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

These are the divs that will house the images, and the text for each card. But before we go on to that lets look into the CSS involved for the cards.

## Styling the cards
First, let's position the cards by giving them a flex display and a background color so we can see them. We will also set their height and size to fit the canvas, with two cards in each row, and give them a rounded border. This can be achieved with the following code:
```css
#cards {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
```
They should look like this:
<style>
  #cards {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
</style>
<div id="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class = "card-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>

Now we are going to add the radial glow that shines when you hover over the cards giving them a cool effect and making them stand out. This can be achieved as so,
```css
.card::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at 100px 100px,
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
    border-radius: inherit; 
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
}
```
This css, uses a radial gradient to draw the circular glow which gives the card the desirable effect. And your cards should look like this now,
<style>
  #cards-part2 {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card-part2{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
.card-part2::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at 100px 100px,
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
    border-radius: inherit; 
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
}
</style>
<div id="cards-part2">
    <div class="card-part2">
      <div class = "card-part2-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part2-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part2">
      <div class = "card-part2-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part2-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part2">
      <div class = "card-part2-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part2-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part2">
      <div class = "card-part2-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part2-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>

Now we will move on to the border. You may be wondering why we have a separate div to house the border. The reason for this is to achieve the hover effect on the border, which, as in the example cards above, will have a different glow and cross over separate cards. Essentially, we will have two divs: one for the border and one for the card container itself. The card container will be layered over the border container, creating the illusion of a border. This is necessary to achieve the desired effect.

So let's add the style for the `.card-border`, first lets modify the previous code to include the `.card-border`, as the only difference between the border and the `.card` are their z-index and radial gradient color:
```css
.card::before,
  .card>.card-border {
    border-radius: inherit;
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
  }
```
To give a quick explantion for what `>` is, esstenially it tells the browser to only apply the style to the direct child of the parent element. So in this case, it will only apply the style to the `.card-border` div, and not the `.card-content` div. This is necessary, as both the `.card-border` and `.card-content` divs are children of the `.card` div, and we only want those styles to only apply to the `.card-border` div.

Next we can add back the radial gradient for the `.card` and also add a new radial gradient for the `.card-border`:
```css
.card::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at 100px 100px,
        rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
  }

  .card>.card-border {
    background: radial-gradient(400px circle at 0px 0px,
        rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 1;
  }
```
Again `>` is used to only apply the style to the direct child of the parent element. And we set the z-index for the `.card-border` to 1, as we want it to be behind the `.card` div and we also have the '.card` div at z-index 3 as later on when we add content to the card, we want it to be on top of the content as well which will be at z-index 2. (*I changed the radial gradient of the border to red and the card to green to make it easier to see what is happening*)

Now your cards should look like this,
<style>
  #cards-part3 {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card-part3{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
.card-part3::before,
  .card-part3>.card-part3-border {
    border-radius: inherit;
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
  }

.card-part3::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at 100px 100px,
        rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
  }

  .card-part3>.card-part3-border {
    background: radial-gradient(400px circle at 0px 0px,
        rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 1;
  }
</style>
<div id="cards-part3">
    <div class="card-part3">
      <div class = "card-part3-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part3-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part3">
      <div class = "card-part3-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part3-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part3">
      <div class = "card-part3-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part3-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part3">
      <div class = "card-part3-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part3-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>

Now we can style the `.card-content` div. First we need to set the dimensions of the `.card-content` div to be slightly smaller than the `.card-border` div, so that the border will be visible and will now look like a border instead of just a div. This is done as so:
```css
.card>.card-content {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: inherit;
    height: calc(100% - 10px);
    margin: 5px;
    width: calc(100% - 10px);
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
  }
```
To get the illusion of the border, we used the `calc()` function to subtract 10px from the height and width of the `.card-content` div which will take the total height and width of the `.card-border` div and subtract 10px from it. This will give us the illusion of a border. We also set the z-index to 2, as we want the `.card-content` div to be on top of the `.card-border` div, but below the `.card` div in order to still see the glow. Leaving us with this:

<style>
  #cards-part4 {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card-part4{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
.card-part4::before,
  .card-part4>.card-part4-border {
    border-radius: inherit;
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
  }

.card-part4::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at 100px 100px,
        rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
  }

  .card-part4>.card-part4-border {
    background: radial-gradient(400px circle at 0px 0px,
        rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 1;
  }

  .card-part4>.card-part4-content {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: inherit;
    height: calc(100% - 10px);
    margin: 5px;
    width: calc(100% - 10px);
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
  }

</style>
<div id="cards-part4">
    <div class="card-part4">
      <div class = "card-part4-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part4-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part4">
      <div class = "card-part4-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part4-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part4">
      <div class = "card-part4-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part4-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part4">
      <div class = "card-part4-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part4-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>

For now we are done styling the cards!

## JavaScript
Finally, the last main step to creating the cards is to have the glow follow our mouse whenever it moves around the screen. To do so, we will code some Javascript to listen for the mouse movement and update the glow accordingly.

Here is the code:
```js
document.getElementById("cards").onmousemove = e => {
        for (const card of document.getElementsByClassName('card')){
          const rect = card.getBoundingClientRect(),
              x = e.clientX - rect.left,
              y = e.clientY - rect.top;
    
            card.style.setProperty('--mouse-x', `${ x }px`);
            card.style.setProperty('--mouse-y', `${ y }px`);
        }
      }
```
To give a quick explaination of the code,
1. First we use `document.getElementById("cards").onmousemove` to listen for the mouse movement on the `#cards` div.
2. We then loop through the `.card` divs within the `#cards` div.
3. First we get the relative position of the card which we store in the `rect` variable.
4. We then get the x and y position of the mouse relative to the card and store it in the `x` and `y` variables by subtracting the true x and y position of the mouse from trhe client and the top left x and y position of the card.
5. Finally, we set the `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y` variables to the `x` and `y` variables respectively in order for them to be used in the CSS.

Also don't forget to make these small changes to the CSS:
```css
.card::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
        rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
  }

  .card>.card-border {
    background: radial-gradient(400px circle at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
        rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 1;
  }
```
This will make the glow follow the mouse, by setting the position of the glow to the position of the mouse.

We should get the following result:
<style>
  #cards-part5 {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 100vw;
    width: calc(100% - 30px);
}
.card-part5{
  background-color: #000;
  height: 290px;
  width: 47.8%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
.card-part5::before,
  .card-part5>.card-part5-border {
    border-radius: inherit;
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    width: 100%;
}

.card-part5::before {
    background: radial-gradient(800px circle at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
        rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 3;
  }

  .card-part5>.card-part5-border {
    background: radial-gradient(400px circle at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
        rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8) 0%,
        transparent 40%);
    z-index: 1;
  }

  .card-part5>.card-part5-content {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: inherit;
    height: calc(100% - 10px);
    margin: 5px;
    width: calc(100% - 10px);
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
  }

</style>
<div id="cards-part5">
    <div class="card-part5">
      <div class = "card-part5-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part5-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part5">
      <div class = "card-part5-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part5-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part5">
      <div class = "card-part5-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part5-content"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-part5">
      <div class = "card-part5-border"></div>
      <div class = "card-part5-content"></div>
    </div>
</div>

And there you have it! For the most part, we have created a card component that has a glow effect that follows the mouse. And basically you can do all the customization you want to it! You can change the colors, the size, the shape, the text, the image, etc just by playing around with the numbers. You can also add more cards to the page if you want to.

For my personal website, I wanted my cards to have an image and a descriptive text below it, in order to display my projects. If you want to know how I did that, you here is the CSS, that achieves that:
```css
.card-content img {
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    height: 80%;
    width: 100%;
  }

  .card-content p {
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
    height: 20%;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 20px;
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
  }
```
This CSS, makes the image only take up 80% of the card, and only have the curved border on the top. It also makes the text only occupy the remaining 20% of the card, and have the curved border on the bottom, with some text formatting to fit the style of my website.

Also to make the cards a hyperlink, just add an `a` tag instead of a `div` tag on the `.card` class, and add the `href` attribute to the `a` tag, and you're good to go!

Heres a quick example:
```html
<div class = "card">
    <a href = "Link-to-whatever-you-want">
    <div class = "card-border"></div>
    <div class = "card-content"><img src = "Image-path"><p></p></div>
    </a>
</div>
```

And with that here we have the finished product!
<div id = "my-project-cards">
<div id = "project-cards">
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\dota.webp"><p>Dota 2 Muerta</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\gojo.jpg"><p>Jujutsu Kaisen Gojo</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\placeholder.png"><p>PlaceHolder</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project-card">
    <div class = "project-card-border"></div>
    <div class = "project-card-content"><img src = "\assets\projects\personal-portfolio\sasuke.jpg"><p>Naruto Sasuke</p></div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>

## Conclusion
Overall,I was very happy with how they turned out and I think they look really cool and blend in really well with the Hydejack theme as well! If you want the source code for the cards, with the color and styling to fit for the Hydejack theme, you can find it [here.](/coding/HTML-CSS-JS/about-page-cards/)
