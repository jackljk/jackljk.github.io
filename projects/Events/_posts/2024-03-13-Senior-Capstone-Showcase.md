# Senior Capstone Showcase
On the 13th of March 2024, after a 2 quarter long journey through UCSD Senior Capstone sequence, we capped it off with a showcase with all the other projects from the other teams. Our project was on Climate Bench Plus where we improved upon Baseline models set by the original Climate Bench paper by our mentor. For more on the project [click here](/projects/events/Senior-Capstone-Showcase/). 

During the showcase, we had to present an elevator pitch to the judges and the audience about our project making sure to be quick and concise. While also making sure we explained it for the level of the current audience. Overall I think the event was a great success, as not only did I gain an amazing experience presenting in front of a large audience and learning how to present my work well but also got to see the amazing work done by other teams in the Senior Capstone sequence which truly broaden my horizons on what can be done with Data Science.
