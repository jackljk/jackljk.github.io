# Datahacks 2024
[Datahacks](https://datahacks.ds3ucsd.com/) is an annual event hosted by the [Data Science Society at UCSD](https://www.ds3ucsd.com/), is a hackathon where students of all backgrounds come together to work on a project for 24 hours. This year the event was held on the 6th-7th of April 2024 at UC San Diego and was held in conjunction with [ACM UCSD's Diamond Hacks](https://diamondhacks.vercel.app/). 

This year I had the pleasure of being the co-director for the event, where I was in charge of organizing the event, finding sponsors, and making sure the event ran smoothly along side my co-director [Jared Simpauco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-simpauco-6a0731223/).  The event was a great success with over 150 participants and 20+ projects being submitted -- [Link to the projects/devpost](https://datahacks-2024.devpost.com/).

I sadly was not able to attend the event in person, as the date that we had chosen coincided with my [College Club Swimming Nationals 2024](/projects/events/CCS-Nationals-2024/), however, due to my absence my co-director Jared was able to run the event smoothly with the help of the rest of the [DS3](https://www.ds3ucsd.com/) team, and as a bonus they even purchased a cardboard cutout of me to be present at the event.
