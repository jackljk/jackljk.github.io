# ASML x DS3 Campus Tour
On the 6th of February 2024, in collaboration with ASML I organized an event with them which consisted of an ASML campus tour and a talk on the future of Data Science and a Q&A session with the ASML team. The event was a huge success with everyone learning a lot about the future of Data Science and the role of ASML in it. Below are some pictures from the event.
