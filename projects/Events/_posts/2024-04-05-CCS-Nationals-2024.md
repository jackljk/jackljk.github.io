# CCS Nationals 2024
The CCS Nationals 2024 was held in the [IU Natatorium](https://www.iupui.edu/), Indianapolis, Indiana. The event was held from the 5th to the 7th of April, this is my second time attenting the CCS Nationals but this time I was not only a competitor but I was also one of the captains for my team [UC San Diego Club Swim](https://www.instagram.com/ucsdclubswim/). 

The event was a great experience, I was able to compete in the 50m Breaststroke and 3 relays, the 200m Medley Relay, 200m Mixed Free Relay and the 800 Free Relay. Although I was not able to achieve any personal best, as a team however, we achieve the best results in the history of the club. We were able to place 11th overall in the team rankings and broke a record number of team records in the process. In addition to all of that, we as a team won the CCS Club Team of the Year award, which was a great honor and a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team throughout the entire year.
