# Predicting Loan Approvals using Machine Learning
In this project, I used Machine Learning to predict the whether a persons Loan gets approved or not using Machine learning and made a working demo of the model using Flask.

## Introduction
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthsai7/loandefault) and contains data on 67,463 rows of data with 35 columns.

The task given was to predict whether a person's loan gets approved or not based of the values given by the dataset and use Machine Learning to predict the outcome.

All my work through the process is documented in the Jupiter Notebook below, or click [here](/coding/ML/loan-prediction/) to go to it.

## Report
As part of the project, I was task to write a summarizing report for the project and the results. The report is written in Latex using the ACM template 
and documents all the important findings, results and conclusions of the project. And how to use the model as a web app.

Click [here](\assets\projects\loan-predictions/report.pdf) or the image below to go to the report.
