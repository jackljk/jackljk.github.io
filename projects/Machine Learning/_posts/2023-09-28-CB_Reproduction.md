# Climate Bench Reproduction

For my quarter 1 for my Senior Project at **UCSD** my project group and I created a reproduction of my mentor's ([Duncan Watson-Parris](https://duncanwp.github.io/)) paper [ClimateBench](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002954).

## What is ClimateBench?
Climate Bench is the first benchmarking framework that leverages data from a set of *Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPS)*, *AerChemMip* and *Detection-Attrition Model Intercomparison Projects* which are extremely complex simulations performed by the state of the art **Earth Model Systems (EMS)**. In order to create a lighter and more accessible benchmark which can be used for climate research and understanding our climate better. 

### What does ClimateBench do?
Essentially Climate Bench takes the data from the CMIPS, AerChemMip, and DAMIP and creates a benchmarking framework using the simulations to emulate and model the possible scenarios of our climate. As of the reproduction of the paper, the model currently predicts 4 different scenarios, which are the following:

- **Mean Surface Air Temperature (TAS)** 
- **Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR)**
- **Precipitation (PR)**
- **90th percentile of daily precipitation (PR90)**

Some of the readily available data can be found on the [ESFG LLNL Website](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/)

## What is the purpose of this reproduction?
The purpose for the reproduction of ClimateBench is for 2 reasons. The first being that, checking the reproducibility of a papers result is a very important step in the scientific process as it verifies the validity of the results. The second reason is that the reproduction allows us the students to understand the domain of climate science better, it allows us ti understand the data that we are dealing with better and also the architecture of the model better. Which is a good segway for the next part of our Senior Project which is to further our professor's work on the model on something new that has not been done before.

## Deliverables of the Reproduction
As part of the reproduction for our senior project we were tasked with the following:

- Reproducing the code for the models
- Creating a report on the reproduction
- A proposal for the next part of the project
- An elevator pitch for the next part of the project

## Conclusion
Overall, the reproduction of the paper was a great learning experience for me, as I was able to learn more about the domain of climate science and also the architecture of the model. I was also able to learn more about the process of reproducing a paper and the importance of it. I am looking forward to the next part of the project where we will be able to further the work of the model and hopefully create something new and impactful.
