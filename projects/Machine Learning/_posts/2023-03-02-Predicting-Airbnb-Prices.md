# Predicting Airbnb Prices using Machine Learning 

In this project which was part of a Kaggle competition for my class DSC148 (Intro to Data Mining) where we were given a dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City and tasked to predict the price of the listing using Machine Learning.

## Introduction
The dataset was given on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ucsd-dsc190-wi23-introduction-to-data-mining/overview) website along with a baseline model to compare our results to. 

The notebook for the project is shown below, click the image or click [here](/coding/ML/airbnb-prediction/) to go to it.
