# Microsoft Gen AI Polyglot Pals
For the [Microsoft AI Hackathon](https://microsoftgenai.devpost.com/), I worked on a project called **Polyglot Pals** which is a language learning platform that uses the power of AI to help users learn a new language. The way it works is that it acts as a friend for the user, allowing the user to speak and write in the language of their choice and the AI will respond back in the same language. The AI is able to understand the context of the conversation and respond back in a way that is both helpful and informative.

For more on the project please see the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/polyglot-pal) page for the project. There is also a demo video of the app in action $$\rightarrow$$ [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOd7ILCMucE)

To try out the app for yourself you can visit the [Polyglot Pals](https://polyglotpal.azurewebsites.net/) website.
