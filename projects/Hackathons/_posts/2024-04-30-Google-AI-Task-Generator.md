# Google AI Task Generator
For the [Google AI Hackthon](https://googleai.devpost.com/), we were tasked with creating a product that utilizes the new Generative AI model Gemini API. My team decided to create a task app which utilizes the Gemini API's ability to understand and comprehend natural language to parse and generate tasks for the user. This allows users to instead of spending time thinking of what to call their tasks, filling in the details, and setting the due date, to just write a sentence or two about the task or copying and pasting notes about the task and let the AI do the rest.

The app is currently built as an IOS app, utilizing googles Flutter framework which allows better cross-platform compatibility in the future. For more on how the application was built and the implementation you can check out the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/tasks-generator) page for the project. There is also a demo video of the app in action $$\rightarrow$$ [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFkfrhndoBQ)

### After the Hackathon
After the hackathon, we decided to continue working on the project and have since then added more features to the app and making it look nicer and more user-friendly, more on this can be found [here](/projects/hackathons/Task-Manager-with-AI/).
