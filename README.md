Viszulization of Dota 2 using Dota 2 open api
This is a personal project of mine which I use to learn and improve my data visualization ability!


## Use of Code
Feel free to look at and use the code as you please! All I ask if for you to at least link my repo if you do!

## Introduction of Project
For this project, I was task to create a Visualization using the [D3 API](https://d3js.org/). It is an Open Ended project,hence I chose to do a Visualization of my favourite game Dota 2.

I used the [Dota 2 Open API](https://docs.opendota.com/) to gather data for the visualization. The task was to create visualizations of various aspects of the game. In order to gain an advantage and discover intricacies within the game, such as which country has the most number of pro players or which hero has the highest total stats for strength, agility, or intelligence.
